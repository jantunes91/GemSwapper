GemSwapper is a Bejeweled clone using C++ and SDL. I did it so I could expand my knowledge and practice of C++ and to get to know SDL.

It still needs a lot of work. In fact, it is terrible in terms of code structure and redability. A memory of how bad of a programmer I was in 2016 and how much I progressed since then.
I may refactor it sometime in the future. Most probably not.
